# Early Risk Detection for Student Academic Performance
## 📌 Problem Statement

Academic failure is often identified too late, after final exams.
This project focuses on early detection of at-risk students using machine learning, enabling timely academic intervention.

The system estimates academic risk scores (Low / Medium / High) as an early-warning signal, rather than making final pass/fail decisions.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains student-level information including:

Study habits

Attendance

Academic background

Previous assessment scores

Only pre-final / mid-semester features are considered to avoid data leakage.

## 🎯 Objective

Identify students at risk of poor performance early

Build an interpretable ML model

Analyze key factors contributing to academic risk

## 🧠 Approach

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Risk category creation

Model training & evaluation

Explainability & bias analysis

## 📈 Models Used

Logistic Regression (baseline)

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Evaluation metrics prioritize Recall and F1-score to minimize false negatives (missing at-risk students).

## 🔍 Key Insights

Attendance and prior scores are the strongest predictors

Performance trends matter more than absolute scores

Models can show bias if not evaluated across subgroups

## 🤖 Modeling Summary

Framed student performance prediction as a **risk assessment problem**

Converted final grades into a binary outcome for model training

Used Logistic Regression with class balancing to prioritize recall

Deployed predictions as **probability-based risk scores** instead of hard labels

Interpreted model behavior using coefficients and feature importance


## 🧪 Prediction Philosophy

The system is designed as an **early-warning model**, not a definitive outcome predictor.

Predictions are intentionally conservative when limited academic signals are available, favoring recall over precision to avoid missing at-risk students.

## ⚠️ Ethical Considerations

Predictions should assist educators, not penalize students

Model decisions must be interpretable

Bias across demographic groups is explicitly evaluated

Predictions are presented as risk indicators, not deterministic judgments, to prevent misuse.


## 🚀 Future Work

Real-time dashboard for educators

Integration with institutional systems

Personalized intervention recommendations

Multi-stage prediction models (early-semester vs mid-semester risk)
